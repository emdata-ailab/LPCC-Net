# LPCC-Net: Local point cloud completion network for 3D object detection

## Introduction
This repository contains the pytorch implementation of **LPCC-NET** introducted in ICME21 paper **"LPCC-NET: RGB GUIDED LOCAL POINT CLOUD COMPLETION FOR OUTDOOR 3D
OBJECT DETECTION."** From which, we we propose an RGB-guided local point cloud completion network, which aims to improve off-the-shelf 3D object detectors by selectively densifying the collected point clouds.
